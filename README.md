## Data management audit

I started documenting all the company's processes. In addition to business processes, I am also covering organizational and strategic aspects, such as the creation of :
- A decision register for management on SharePoint.
- A Kanban project management board using MS Planner.
- Implementation of a logical classification structure based on the decimal method.

I am also responsible for creating and maintaining several repositories to document changes within the IT infrastructure, including in SharePoint and other softwares.
Either using OneNote for large and heavy document subject to customization or SharePoint lists when appropriate

<!-- For each one, go through:

- What your contributions were (did you come up with the design? Which
components did you build? Was there some useful insight like “wait, we can cut
scope and do what we want by doing way less work” that you came up with?)
- The impact of the project – who was it for? Are there numbers you can attach
to it? (saved X dollars? shipped new feature that has helped sell Y big deals?
Improved performance by X%? Used by X internal users every day?). Did it support
some important non-numeric company goal (required to pass an audit? helped
retain an important user?)

Remember: don’t forget to explain what the results of you work actually were!
It’s often important to go back a few months later and fill in what actually
happened after you launched the project. -->


  


<!-- Examples of things in this category:

- Helping others in an area you’re an expert in (like “other engineers regularly
ask me for one-off help solving weird bugs in their CSS” or “quoting from the C
standard at just the right moment”)

- Helping new team members get started
- Writing really clear emails/meeting notes
- Foundational code that other people built on top of
- Improving monitoring / dashboards / on call
- Any code review that you spent a particularly long time on / that you think
was especially important
- Important questions you answered (“helped Risha from OTHER_TEAM with a lot of
questions related to Y”)
- Mentoring someone on a project (“gave Ben advice from time to time on leading
his first big project”)
- Giving an internal talk or workshop -->

## Design & documentation

<!-- List design docs & documentation that you worked on:

- Design docs: I usually just say “wrote design for X” or “reviewed design for
X”
- Documentation: maybe briefly explain the goal behind this documentation (for
example “we were getting a lot of questions about X, so I documented it and
now we can answer the questions more quickly”) -->

## Company building

<!-- This means “things you did to help the company overall, not just your
project / team”. Some things that go in here:

- Going above & beyond with interviewing or recruiting (doing campus recruiting,
etc.)
- Improving important processes, like the interview process or writing better
onboarding materials
- Working groups e.g. diversity, hiring etc. -->

## What you learned

<!-- Try listing important things you learned or skills you’ve acquired recently
(bonus points if you did a write up on it after)! Some examples of skills you
might be learning or improving:

- How to do performance analysis & make code run faster
- Internals of an important piece of software (like the JVM or Postgres or Linux)
- How to use a library (like React)
- How to use an important tool (like the command line or Firefox dev tools)
- About a specific area of programming (like localization or timezones)
- A new area like product management / UX design / software engineering
- How to write a clear design doc
- A new programming language

It’s really easy to lose track of what skills you’re learning, and usually when
I reflect on this I realize I learned a lot more than I thought and also notice
things that I’m not learning that I wish I was. -->
