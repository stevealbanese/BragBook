## What I learned
- HR is not for me → I absolutely abhor HR work with every fibre of my being.

- Compliance adds weight but builds trust → Writing internal regulations, GDPR notices, and codes of conduct made me realize how essential clear governance is.
- Safety matters → QHSE training reminded me that workplace safety is not a box-ticking exercise but an ongoing awareness effort.
- Sustainability is a long game → Upgrading ratings and launching certifications (B Corp, labels) is less about quick wins and more about steady, structured progress.
- No-code ≠ no effort → Tools that promise simplicity still demand technical adaptability and a problem-solving mindset.
